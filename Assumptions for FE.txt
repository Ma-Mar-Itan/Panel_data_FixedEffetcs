Assumptions Explained for FE
    1. Strict Exogeneity of Regressors. Not correlated with the error 
    2. Random Sampling Across Individuals
    3. No Extreme Outliers (Finite Moments)
    4. No Perfect Multicollinearity

Assumptions Explained for CRE
   1. Correlation Structure: The unobserved individual effects may be correlated with the observed independent variables. Yes
   2. Error Independence: The errors ϵ​ are assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with mean zero and constant variance. Use Driscoll-Kraay SEs
   3. Time-Stationarity: The random effects, while correlated with explanatory variables, are assumed to be stable over time for a given entity.
   4. Correct Specification: The model must correctly specify the functional form and include all relevant variables to avoid omitted-variable bias.
